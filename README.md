# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is like a Bus Stop locator where student need to pick from their home, the Google api and Place Api is used in this so that it will map and connect all the student address so that the School authority will easily detected where the student pick up point is in the GOOGLE MAP.
React, Material Ui, css,node.js,npm,yarn, in some cases for fixing bugs in program, FIREBASE for hosting application , AXIOS and google cloud features has been used in this web app.
API added in this project is no longer working , so please add your own:
